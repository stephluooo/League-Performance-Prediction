## Introduction

This project investigates the competitive dynamics of professional esports leagues, specifically focusing on tier-one leagues, namely the LPL, LCK, LEC, and LCS. The central question of our study is: Which tier-one league delivers the most “action-packed” games based on player performance statistics?

Our dataset comprises 18,020 rows and contains critical columns relevant to player performance and game metrics. These include:

- position: The role of the player in the game (e.g., top, jungle, mid, bot, support).
- damagetochampions: Total damage dealt to champions.
- dpm: Damage per minute, a key indicator of a player’s offensive impact.
- damageshare: The percentage of the team’s damage output contributed by the player.
- wardsplaced and controlwardsbought: Indicators of map vision control.
- earnedgold and earnedgoldshare: Metrics for resources acquired during the game.

Understanding the nuances of these metrics not only helps compare the leagues but also offers insights into team dynamics and individual player contributions. This project aims to bridge the gap in data-driven esports analysis by quantifying the “action” level of games using these performance metrics. By doing so, we hope to provide valuable perspectives for both competitive gaming enthusiasts and analysts.
